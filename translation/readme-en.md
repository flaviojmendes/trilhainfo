# Trilha Info

Hi ðŸ‘‹

If you've reached this repo it's because you're wondering how to contribute to the [Trilha Info](https://www.trilha.info/). It's pretty simple!

I am currently asking for contributions to the Frontend Roadmap. Just send a Pull Request to edit the [JSON](https://github.com/flaviojmendes/trilhainfo/tree/main/src/roadmaps) that contains all the information.

## Disclaimer

The idea is to initially engage the community and then we can evolve the portal as we have the need. ðŸ˜€

## How to run locally?

To run the project you can simply clone/fork the project and execute the following steps:

Copy the example env variables:

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local
```

In the env.local file, you have the option to use a local running API or the trilha's own API, just uncomment and use whatever you find better.

Para rodar o projeto em desenvolvimento, vocÃª vai do Yarn para instalar as dependÃªncias e iniciar o servidor:

To run the project in development, you need to have Yarn installed to install the dependencies and start the server:

```sh
# Install the dependencies with:
$ yarn

# Run in developer mode:
$ yarn dev

```

Running with Docker:

You must have the docker-compmose installed on your computer, then execute:

```sh
# on the root of the project
docker-compose up
```

With the API running locally:

```sh
# reutilize the same .env.local as mentioned before, then run:
docker-compose --env-file ./.env.local up
```
